here how i will create this  project, we can follow these steps:

Set up a Flask backend that can receive audio packets from the frontend via Socket.IO. You can use the Flask-SocketIO library to achieve this.

Create a React frontend with a button to start recording audio. You can use a library like react-mic for capturing audio.

Use Socket.IO to establish a connection between the frontend and the backend. Send the audio packets to the backend using Socket.IO.

Use a speech-to-text API like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text to transcribe the audio. You can use the google-cloud-speech library to interact with the API.

Use the Flask-SocketIO library to send the interim and final results back to the frontend.

Implement logic in the frontend to update the textfield with the interim and final results as they are received.

Use a library like VAD.js to detect voice activity in the audio stream and prevent sending data to the backend when there is no talking.

Here are some resources that can help you get started with these steps:

Flask-SocketIO documentation: https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

React-mic library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mic

Socket.IO documentation: https://socket.io/docs/v4/index.html

Google Cloud Speech-to-Text documentation: https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs

google-cloud-speech library documentation: https://googleapis.dev/python/speech/latest/index.html

VAD.js library: https://github.com/caroaguilar/vad.js

in thss way we will be  able to build a functional audio streaming and transcription system that meets the current   acceptance criteria.
